## General Info

This repository contains the prompt and results for our research paper **"TVR: Automotive System Requirement Traceability Validation and Recovery Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation"**. Our paper focus on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automotive system requirement traceability validation and recovery.

## Note

Note that the dataset used in this paper originates from industrial data, and the LLMs adopted are services provided by our industrial partners. Therefore, we are unable to open-source our dataset and code. However, for the consideration of publicity, we opensourced our experiment results and prompts here.
